## Overview

üÜé *–≠—Ç–æ—Ç —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º —è–∑—ã–∫–µ: [README-ru.md](README-ru.md).*

This is a minimal stand-alone Ruby project with a ready-to-use RSpec setup.
It can be used as a starting point to try and prototype your own tests
on almost every OS, version of Ruby, or RSpec itself.

## Setup

> üí° *It's assumed that you have Git installed.*

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dadooda/rspec_skel.git
```

Install the gems:

```sh
bundle install
```

Edit `.gitignore` and remove these two lines:

```
# REMOVE this comment and the line following it ‚Ä¶
/Gemfile.lock
```

Remove linkage to the skeleton repo, and initialize your own:

```sh
rm -rf .git &&
git init

```

## Usage

> üí° *It's assumed that you have Ruby installed.*

The class files are located in [lib/](lib). The spec files are located in [spec/](spec).

### Run RSpec

```sh
bundle exec rspec
```

With coverage:

```sh
SPEC_COV=! bundle exec rspec
```

### Generate YARD documentation

```sh
bundle exec yard
```

The docs are rendered in `doc/`. Open `doc/index.html` to browse.

### Shell extensions

The project comes bundled with a few optional shell extensions some may find convenient.
The extensions are located in [shell/](shell). To load them all at once, do a:

```sh
. shell/all.sh
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Only Bash is supported at the moment.*

Here's a brief summary:

Command | File | Action
-|-|-
`b` | `bundler.sh` | A shorter alias to `bundle`.
`bx` | `bundler.sh` | A shorter alias to `bundle exec`.
`cov` | `rspec.sh` | Run `sp` with coverage enabled.
`rc` | `rg.sh` | `rg` with colors and other friendly options baked in.
`sp` | `rspec.sh` | Run RSpec tests matching a given Egrep mask.
